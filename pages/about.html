					<h1>About</h1>
						<p class="is-size-5-tablet"><a href="https://newgazette.co" target="_blank">The New Gazette</a> provides curated local news in an unbiased and balanced way because news needs to help people live well in their city, not just appease advertisers.</p>
						<p class="is-size-5-tablet">Part of our commitment to do right by our neighbors includes offering a summary of our most important headlines from each month for free, in a format called <a href="https://newgazette.co/#brief" target="_blank">The Monthly Brief</a>. To ensure that these news summaries continue to be available, they are maintained on this website as pdf files and can be browsed on this site or via RSS.</p>
						<p class="is-size-5-tablet">Additionally, after our paid weekly editions are more than three months old, they will be made available here as well.</p>
						<p class="is-size-5-tablet">Happy reading!</p>
